# Becoming a Better Developer

## Very Quick Personal Intro
 - I have been developing professionally for over 25 years
 - I love it
 - I also love developing other developers


## Why this talk?
 - I believe we all can become better 
 - If you are the same person in 10 years as you are today then you are going backwards
 - Boat analogy - everything is moving on the water. If you stop rowing, stop putting energy into your live, your relationships, you are going backwards. 
 - Newtons laws of motion apply just as much to your life as they do to physical objects
  - newtons laws

## Relationships 
 - probably the most important thing in your life
 - no man is an island - no matter how introverted you are and how muych you need your space. Life is enriched by others. Make space to catch up with friends, make space for fun with your family and your kids.


## Money (pink floyd - money)

 - the most important money eqn 
 - assets = liabilities + owners equity
 - revevue = expences + profit
 - the stuff that comes in  = the stuff that goes out + whats left over
 - so create a buffer - either in your business or your personal finances it is hard to operate when you are 'red lining'
 - you wouldnt drive you lambo with the rev counter 'red lining' so dont drive your finances that way
