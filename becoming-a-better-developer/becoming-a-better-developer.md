## Why this talk?
 - I believe we all can become better 
 - If you are the same person in 10 years as you are today then you are going backwards
 - Kayak analogy - everything is moving on the water. If you stop paddling, stop putting energy into your live, your relationships, you are going backwards. 

## Motion

## Creativity

## Values

## Relationships 

 - probably the most important thing in your life
 - no man is an island - no matter how introverted you are and how muych you need your space. Life is enriched by others. Make space to catch up with friends, make space for fun with your family and your kids.


## Money [Money](https://open.spotify.com/track/0vFOzaXqZHahrZp6enQwQb?si=8e4e3c2786a94ec6)

 - the most important money eqn 
 - assets = liabilities + owners equity
 - revevue = expences + profit
 - the stuff that comes in  = the stuff that goes out + whats left over
 - so create a buffer - either in your business or your personal finances it is hard to operate when you are 'red lining'
 - you wouldnt drive you lambo with the rev counter 'red lining' so dont drive your finances that way

## Power 

 - Leadership creates a power imbalance
 - You are paid more and can do more that those you lead - esp at CEO levels
 - So use that power wisely to develop your team rather than lording it over them (see the Sydney Swans rule)

## Commuunity
 - How can you contribute?
   - code

   - examples
   - meetups
   - tests
   - ...
