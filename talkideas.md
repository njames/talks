(what's rust but a fangled new compiler?)

Everyone is getting on the Rust Train but where does Rust sit in your landscape? 
You may well be using a program built in rust or a program that has components of 
Rust in it. In this talk we will take out some of the mystery of Rust and learn 
how it might be useful in our next project.

## Enterprise Laravel

Without wanting to cover ground Matt has ably covered in the last couple of years 
I would like to cover this and continue the pitch for Laravel in the bigger shops. 
Many large enterprises use Java or .net for most of their business logic but there 
is no good reason that PHP and Laravel cant have a place here. 
Having processed thousands of invoices daily on vapor I know it is possible and 
even the stuff I was doing wasnt really that big. 

The dot points I would like to cover would be
+ What do the big shops to run their business? 
+ Where can Laravel fit?
+ How to integrate with the big end of town.
+ Some examples of large enterprises using Laravel.
