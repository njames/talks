# Talks

All my talks in markdown so I can edit from anywhere and present with sli.dev


## Reuse at will 
While this is a WIP space while talks are developed, you are open to use or reuse this content.

## Use with sli.dev
Install the slidev cli globally with:
`npm i -g @slidev/cli`

In each talk folder there is a file call slides.md

To use and present from this repository clone in the normal way eg:
`git clone git@github.com:njames/talks.git`

cd to a talk / directory and then use the `slidev` command to start the slides.
