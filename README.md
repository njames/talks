# Talks

All my talks in markdown so I can edit from anywhere and present with reveal.js


## Reuse at will ~for non-commercial use.~ 
While this is a WIP space while talks are developed, you are open to reuse this content with a non-commercial attribution licence. 
That means in broad terms personal learning is great. ~, while getting paid to deliver this material is not.~ 

You know what - if you can get paid for deliving this content from these slides - send me an email and we will work something out ;)
